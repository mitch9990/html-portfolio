<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mitchell Finch, i'm 24 years old from Kent. I'm a big Anime fan and a huge Star Wars nerd.<br /> I love drawing 
    and being creative, by hand and digitally. I enjoy learning new things, overcoming challenges<br /> and putting my mind to 
    the test to solve problems. I'm currently learning how to code because I have aspirations<br /> of becoming a Web Developer 
    for a big tech company one day. This project is the start of my journey that is going <br /> to change my life. I hope to
    vastly improve my skills, reach my goals and dive head first into the exciting tech industry.
